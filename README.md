# Thanthan App
This is a mobile app made with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native. Using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the backend database. The app is not fully done in it's current state but it is functional and has User Authentication, CRUD functionality and a basic User Interface. Test user login details can be found in the 'test-users.txt' which can used to login and view the contents of the app. A database seed file is also provided in 'lib/seed.ts' and can be used to generate new types of data for further testing.
